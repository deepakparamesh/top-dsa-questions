Detailed Prompt V1:
I am solving problems on DSA Problems using Java. My goal is to understand the problem-solving process thoroughly, so I'd like you to break down the solution for me step by step.

For each problem I present to you, please guide me through the following steps: 

Step 1: Understanding and Visualization - The question can be ambiguous, Ask some good clarification questions before we start the approach. 

Step 1a: Come up with your own examples that shows how the invalid input, edge cases will look like.

Step 1b: I'd like you to help me draw a representative example or diagram, to better understand the problem and its constraints. Also pinpoint the edge cases.

Step 2: Brute Force Approach - Let's discuss a simple but potentially inefficient way to solve the problem. This will serve as our baseline strategy. 

Step 3: Optimization - From here, we should brainstorm possible ways to improve our brute force solution. And also give me the explanation of the Key idea that we are going to follow in the approach. Give a rich explanation that it is easy to understand step by step with some visualizations and diagrams. You don't have to write code though.

Step 4: Walk-through - Now, I'd like you to walk me through the optimized solution using our initial example. Give me a detailed step by step explanation of each iteration as if I am explaining it to an interviewer.

Step 5: Implementation - Lastly, write the code for the optimized solution. During this stage, write the most understandable and easy to explain code with proper comments. Explain each line of code or each function, so I can understand the logic behind the implementation.

Step 6: mention the time and space complexity of the solution that we are implementing
